I have been working at Apple full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
We work with geniuses - in every department, We create innovative products that thrill our customers and create new product categories - who else can say that?
Cons
ZERO ZERO ZERO work/life balance. Execs have been saying for YEARS that they understand and will make it better. But in actuality, it gets worse every year! It is obviously top management LIP SERVICE because if they meant it, they could fix it tomorrow. They have hundreds of BILLIONS in the bank. If they REALLY cared about employee work/life balance, they could bring aboard the right number of folks...
