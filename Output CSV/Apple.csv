""Not what you’d expect""
Senior Advisor in Killeen, TX
Neutral Outlook
Disapproves of CEO
I worked at Apple
Pros
Consistent work. Looks good on a resume.
Cons
To many to list. Very miss leading company. Main issue is they say promotions and career advancement is high. It’s not. Sure they give you tons of new products and skills to work on but never one raise your pay even though you do 5 times more work then the initial job offer.
Advice to Management
Learn to follow apple policy better.

""Love my job""
 I have been working at Apple
Pros
I love working from home. My managers have always focused on helping me improve and move up in my career. They are so supportive and I feel like they really have my back. I feel like the training is adequate and I am prepared for calls when I get to the phones. I love my opportunity for advancement and have a lot of different avenues I can take within the company.
Cons
Work/life balance is pretty bad. They do offer different schedule choices but I always have to either work weekends or a super late shift and I don’t get to spend time with my family. Every time my new schedule releases, I always refresh my resume thinking I’m going to find another place to work that has more reliable schedule but I can’t ever beat the pay that Apple offers so I’m just forever stuck with a terrible...

Advice to Management
Implement the “Follow the Sun” scheduling that so many people want. It fixes the scheduling problem all together.

Current Employee - Genius Administrator

Negative Outlook
No opinion of CEO
I have been working at Apple part-time for more than a year
Pros
The people are a fantastic community of diversity and innovation
Cons
Very difficult to advance into a full time role. Their metrics for success often change from manager to manager and the metric for success is unknown, even by management. They will ask you to define your own metric and quantify your success, even without understanding your role. In addition, advancement seems to be done on seniority and preference, not by work done.
Advice to Management
Clearly define success and obtain a metric for your own staff to reach. Promotional opportunities should be clearly defined and ample time given to all to apply for the position.

Approves of CEO
I have been working at Apple full-time for more than 8 years
Pros
The company as a whole is an awesome place to work at.
Great benefit, health, pay, personal development
Great work life balance.
Cons
The company as a whole is an awesome place to work at.
Fake senior local management team. Fake sincerity, and a display of dictatorship.
Whenever there is feedback from the floor, we are encouraged to take it outside of the documentation. Leaving only the good looking scores (which are mostly about the company as a whole, not the specific organisation they are working in).
Advice to Management
Sometimes the score card of your senior management team are not the true reflection of how the team feel.
