Pros
The culture here is phenomenal. The message is all about how the people make the difference and the company is very focused on developing employees. 

The routines set in place to reinforce the behaviors are phenomenal. Resources available to leaders for improving coaching style are endless! They have even taken external leadership theories and incorporated those into the resources and training available. 

Highly...

Cons
Some systems are a bit antiquated, but to be honest I’d prefer that over flashy stuff that glitches out all the time. 

Time off is not very competitive, and it doesn’t increase with positions that have more responsibility, it only increases with years worked at the company. 

No fully comprehensive health plan, but they do offer a company funded HSA with one of the plans.

Pros
No ""official"" sales goals. Decent pay and benefits. Good database with product information along with a ""back office"" that can give you extra information regarding certain situations. Bonuses are mainly determined by customer service reviews. Overall great job if your coworkers and management are as dedicated to the job as you are.
Cons
Can be overwhelming at times due to specific customer situations. Quarterly/weekly meetings can become redundant. If management is bad and unwilling to improve behavior, it can create a toxic work environment.
Advice to Management
If you've been in the company for over 5+ years, learn to adapt to the new way of things. Be humble and listen to both bankers and tellers when they have ideas to improve branch/sales efficiency.

Pros
Professional work environment, solid compensation and incentive program, great medical and 401K benefits, and awesome paid time off
Cons
People in positions of power sometimes abuse that power. You can have a really great and fulfilling experience or absolutely miserable depending on your branch and management team. ""Sales"" went away but sales pressure did not.
Advice to Management
Don't put so much pressure on employees to have awkward, forced conversations for the purpose of selling more products or getting more referrals. Customers are not dumb and know what is going on, it makes them feel uncomfortable too! Having someone looking over your shoulder with every interaction and telling them all the things they could improve on does not bolster morale or make them want to be better/improve.
