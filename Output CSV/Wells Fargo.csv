""Coming to work here was the best decision ever.""

I have been working at Wells Fargo full-time for less than a year
Pros
The culture here is phenomenal. The message is all about how the people make the difference and the company is very focused on developing employees. 

The routines set in place to reinforce the behaviors are phenomenal. Resources available to leaders for improving coaching style are endless! They have even taken external leadership theories and incorporated those into the resources and training available. 

Highly...

Cons
Some systems are a bit antiquated, but to be honest I’d prefer that over flashy stuff that glitches out all the time. 

Time off is not very competitive, and it doesn’t increase with positions that have more responsibility, it only increases with years worked at the company. 

No fully comprehensive health plan, but they do offer a company funded HSA with one of the plans.

Pros
Good benefits package. Plenty of opportunity for development.
Cons
Busy branches have a huge workload on top of having to work Saturday's. Work-life balance is currently not ideal
Advice to Management
It's not reasonable for Saturday branches to self staff and work six days a week half of the month. Team members are burning out.

""Personal Banker""
Former Employee - Anonymous Employee 
Recommends
No opinion of CEO
I worked at Wells Fargo full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
No ""official"" sales goals. Decent pay and benefits. Good database with product information along with a ""back office"" that can give you extra information regarding certain situations. Bonuses are mainly determined by customer service reviews. Overall great job if your coworkers and management are as dedicated to the job as you are.
Cons
Can be overwhelming at times due to specific customer situations. Quarterly/weekly meetings can become redundant. If management is bad and unwilling to improve behavior, it can create a toxic work environment.
Advice to Management
If you've been in the company for over 5+ years, learn to adapt to the new way of things. Be humble and listen to both bankers and tellers when they have ideas to improve branch/sales efficiency.
