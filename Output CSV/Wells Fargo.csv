""wouldn't recommend.""
Current Employee - Customer Service Representative 
Doesn't Recommend
I have been working at Wells Fargo full-time
Pros
The Vacation days are Great! 180 hours your first year. Vacation and sick days are combined.
Cons
Working conditions are subpar, Branches are always understaffed and the recruitment process takes months. There is no clear differentiation between CSSR and Personal Bankers as far as work and experience. However, Personal Bankers make more money.
Advice to Management
Put your staff first!
